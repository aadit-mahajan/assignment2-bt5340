## Zimm Bragg model for helix-coil transition
  
The script 'zimm_bragg.py' contains the code for running the model and generating the required plots.       
'test.ipynb' has been left as a sandbox notebook.      

The free energy plots obtained from the zimm-bragg model are organized in three subfolders:          
1. Scenario A - modelled for (s > 1)      
2. Scenario B - modelled for (s < 1)      
3. Scenario C - modelled for two separate sequences of residues with high propensity of helix formation      

## Monte Carlo simulation for single helix folding
The script 'MC.ipynb' contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulation runs, the analysis used, and the plot generation code.
